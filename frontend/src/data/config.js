    `<p>In Missouri, expungement is the legal process in which criminal records, like police reports and indictments, are sealed from state government records. </p>
     <p>Expungement does not result in the record being erased or destroyed. There are ways in which the record may be accessed, e.g. applying for a nursing license.</p>
     <p>Expungement does not remove any record or mention of the criminal activity from the public, e.g. a news article mentioning an arrest would not be changed.</p>
